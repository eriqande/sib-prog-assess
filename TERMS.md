As a work of an employee of the United States Government, this work is in the
public domain within the United States. 

Except for included sections which
are under other terms.  Notably, we include the code for version 4.8-0.2 of the 
R package glpk.  (We include the code here because later changes to glpk broke 
the code we had written, and we wanted to maintain some reproducibility here.)
glpk is distributed under GPL-2.

This will not preclude publication in a journal.
